Simple lightweight logger utility for the Arduino platform.

---

Currently it defaults on the main serial port of the board.

---

Supported formatters:
  %b - binary value
  %d - int / byte
  %f - double / float
  %s - char string
  %x - hex value

--- 

To enable the Log, place the following define statement in
the class you are including everthing in:
    #define DEVELOPMENT_LOG

To set the log level place the following define statement in
the class you are including everything in:
    #define LOG_LEVEL <Log_Level>

Make sure you have the include statements setup properly after
the Log define statements. 

Example Usage:

    #define  DEVELOPMENT_LOG
    #define  LOG_LEVEL INFO_LEVEL
    #include Log.h
    
    Log::fine ("Fine statement");
    Log::debug ("Debug statement");
    Log::info ("Info statement ");
    Log::warn ("Warn statement");
    Log::error ("Error Statement");

    Log::info ("Int: %d", 5);
    Log::info ("Double: %f", 5.5);
    Log::info ("Chars: %s", "test string");
    Log::info ("Binary of 5: %b", 5);
    Log::info ("Hex of 47: %x", 47);
       
    Log::info ("Unrecognized formatter: %p", 1);
